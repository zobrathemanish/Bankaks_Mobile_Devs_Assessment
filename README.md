IT Team Recruitment Procedure Android App Project Task


ABSTRACT

This project is intended to create a mobile application that focuses on use of API , coding consistency and error handling and edge cases. This app gives the basic functionality of making 
a bill payment, hence provides a overview backend of the task. This app is based on dynamic rendering and uses mostly JAVA rather than the use of XML. 


OVERVIEW

This task got me to get familiar with Android development environment and use of several libraries. I basically focused on data fetching part from API and somehow utilize it to develop this billing app. What this app does is fairly simple, you enter a service given in the dropdown menu. Once the option is selected and user proceeds, the API endpoint will be hit with an input parameter called type and according to itâ€™s value, we will have the contents and details of dynamic screen on the second screen. In second page, some inputs are asked according to the service fetched through API and validation is performed. If validation becomes successful, then it is redirected to the next page, otherwise, error toast message is given. 


LIBRARIES USED

- MaterialSpinner for selecting dummy options.
- Android widget EditText
